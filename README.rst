Sceptre is a tool to drive AWS `CloudFormation <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`_. It automates away some of the more mundane, repetitive and error-prone tasks, allowing you to concentrate on building better infrastructure.

Sceptre's source code can be found `here <https://github.com/cloudreach/sceptre>`_.

Features:

- Code reusability by separating a stack's template and its configuration
- Support for templates written in JSON, YAML or Python DSLs such as Troposphere
- Dependency resolution by passing of stack outputs to parameters of dependent stacks
- Environment support by bundling related stacks into logical groups (e.g. dev and prod)
- Environment-level commands, such as creating multiple stacks with a single command
- Fast, highly parallelised builds
- Built in support for working with stacks in multiple AWS accounts
- Infrastructure visibility with meta-operations such as stack querying protection
- Support for inserting dynamic values in templates via customisable resolvers
- Support for running arbitrary code as hooks before/after stack builds


Code
-------

Sceptre organises stacks into environments. Each stack is represented by a YAML configuration file stored in a directory which represents the environment. Here, we have two environments, ``prod`` and ``dev`` ::
